- role: Graduate Students
  status: |+
    I am not looking to take on new M.S. or Ph.D students for the 2023-24 admissions cycle. However, if you have external funding (or are interested in applying for external funding), feel free to reach out!

    There are projects for M.Eng. students if you're interested in a project that aligns with our research and mission.
  apply: Please see the lab manual's <a href="https://viveks.bee.cornell.edu/lab-manual/applying/graduate/">application instructions for graduate students</a>. Feel free to <a href="mailto:viveks@cornell.edu">email Vivek</a> to introduce yourself and ask questions.

- role: Postdoctoral Researchers
  status: We are looking to hire a postdoc to work on coastal flood risk modeling. Particular areas of interest include agent-based modeling and infrastructure modeling, but the successful candidate will have a large degree of freedom in designing their research portfolio. I am also happy to work with you on other postdoctoral opportunities, within Cornell or externally-funded. Please <a href="mailto:viveks@cornell.edu">reach out</a> for more information.
